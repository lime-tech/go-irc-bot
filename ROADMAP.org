* TODO
  - [ ] Authenticated http queries?
  - [ ] HTTPS support?
  - [ ] More options to control http server
  - [ ] Support multiple protocols

* Ideas
  - Ring cache for each user that have contacted the bot
    Limits on how many caches stored and how many messages in each cache
    User should be able to request ther cache
    and maybe it should request other caches, there should be a flag in config to allow this
