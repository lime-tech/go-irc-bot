* TODO
  - [ ] Message preprocess function in lua(or other embedded language)
    This will enable aliases and will give full compatibility with relays
  - [ ] Authenticated HTTP API
  - [ ] HTTPS support
  - [ ] More options to control HTTP server
  - [ ] Support multiple protocols
    Maybe refactor the code to make intergation with some things like jabber easy
    (maybe someone from community will PR the module?),
    IRC is simple and very powerful, not sure I want other

* Ideas
  - Ring cache for each user that have contacted the bot
    Limits on how many caches stored and how many messages in each cache
    User should be able to request ther cache
    and maybe it should request other caches, there should be a flag in config to allow this
